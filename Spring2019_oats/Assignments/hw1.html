<b>Due at the start of class on February 14</b>

Install scikit-learn for Python.  If you are a Windows user, download
the latext WinPython distribution
from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/winpython/files/">here</a>.
Go through the installation process, and find "IPython QT Console" and
run it.  That will give you a Python command prompt with all of the
packages you need.  If you are a Linux
user, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36384447/how-to-install-sklearn/36384535">this</a>
Stack Overflow question and answer shows you how to install it.

Once you've got Python and scikit-learn running, <b>execute the following
code and submit the output.</b>

</p><pre>from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
import numpy as np


digits = datasets.load_digits()

for n in range(1, 501, 50):
    clf = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors = n)
    scores = cross_val_score(clf, digits.data, digits.target, cv = 10)
    print('k = %d, acc = %.2f' % (n, np.mean(scores)))
</pre>

You'll notice that the cross-validated accuracy scores are
decreasing.  <b>Explain why that is happening in a sentence or two.</b>

<p>

Consider the following decision tree:

<b> Draw the decision boundaries
defined by this tree.  Each leaf is labeled with a letter.  Write this
letter in the corresponding region of instance space.
