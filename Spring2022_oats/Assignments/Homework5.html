<p>

<b>Due at the start of class on Monday March 9th</b>

</p><p>

<p>
  
Get the example PyTorch CNN code that learns to classify CIFAR 10
images from  here:

</p><pre>https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html</pre>

There are links at the top of that page to download the notebook
directly and to see it on GitHub where you can download it as well.

<p>

  Here are your tasks and what you'll need to turn in for each of them:
  </p><ul>
    <li> Run the notebook once without any modifications up to, but
    not including, the cell that explains how to run on a GPU.
    Running on the CPU will be fine for this homework.  The last cell
    you'll run shows the accuracy of the CNN for each of the 10
    classes on the test data.  Submit those accuracies as the first
      thing in your writeup.
    </li><li> Experiment with several (at least 4) ways of improving the
      accuracy of the CNN.  Some things you can consider include:
      <ul>
	<li> Running training longer
	</li><li> Changing the learning rate and other hyperparameters
	</li><li> Increase or decrease the number of convolutional filters
	</li><li> Change the number or sizes of the fully connected layers
	</li><li> Change the size/stride of the filters
	</li><li> Add more convolutional layers
	</li><li> Try a nonlinearity other than ReLIU
	</li><li> Add dropout
      </li></ul>
      Make at least 4 changes to the network one at a time.  That is,
      try one change, revert back to the original network, try another
      change, and repeat.  The goal is to see the impact of one thing
      by itself.  For each change, write up why you think it will help
      or hurt, submit the test accuracy for all of the classes, and
      explain what happened (did it help or hurt accuracy and why?).
      Then, create a final network using as many modifications as you
      like, say what they are, and submit the final test accuracy
      over all of the classes.

      <p>

	At least one change must involve modifying the structure of
	the network, i.e., the number of layers, the sizes of layers,
	the numbers of filters, etc.
