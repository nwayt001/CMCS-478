<p>

<b>Due at 11:30am on March 21st</b>

</p><p>

In this homework you will implement k-means clustering and experiment
with different ways of initializing the cluster centroids.

</p><p>

The <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">MNIST dataset</a> is a
well-studied collection of handwritten digits.  It is often used to
test multi-class classification algorithms, where there is one class
for each of the 10 digits (0 - 9).  In this homework, you will use it for
unsupervised clustering.

</p><p>

I've made two files available for you:
</p><ul>
<li> <a href="https://courses.cs.umbc.edu/undergraduate/478/spring2022/mnist_data.txt">The raw MNIST data</a>, which is a text file
  containing 10,000 rows. Each row contains 28 * 28 = 784 integers in
  the range 0 to 255. 
  Each integer is the pixel value from a 28 x 28 image of a
  handwritten digit.  Every row corresponds to a vector in the dataset
  that is to be clustered.
</li><li> <a href="https://courses.cs.umbc.edu/undergraduate/478/spring2022/mnist_labels.txt">The labels for the raw data</a> are in a file with
  10,000 rows.  The first row contains the correct digit label for the
  first row in the raw data.  The second row is the label for the
  second instance, and so on.
</li></ul>

<p>

Implement the k-means clustering algorithm.  You will only use your
algorithm for this dataset, so you can hard-wire in the number of
instances and the size of each instance.  The goal is not to write a
generic version of the algorithm (though you can if you wish).  The
goal is to understand how it works on real data.  You will need to try
different values of k so that must be a parameter.

</p><p>

After completing the implementation (and testing for correctness, of
course), do the following:
</p><ul>
<li> Randomly sample k = 10 instances, use them as the initial cluster
  centroids, and run the algorithm to covergence.  For each cluster,
  find the most common digit in that cluster and count the number of
  instances in the cluster that are different from the most common
  one.  Sum that count over all of the clusters.
</li><li> Repeat the above step 10 times in total and report the average
  number of iterations to convergence and the average number of
  instances that are in the wrong cluster.
</li><li> Run the algorithm with k = 5.  Look at the clusters and see if
  there are digits that tend to get grouped together.  What are they
  and explain why you think they are grouped into the same cluster.
</li><li> Finally, run the algorithm 10 times again with k = 10 and report
  the same information as above (iterations to convergence and number
  of wrongly clustered instances).  But this time do not choose random
  instances for the cluster centroids.  Randomly choose an instance
  that represents each of the digits and use them as the centroids.
  That is, one of the centroids will be a randomly chose 0, another
  will be a randomly chose 1, and so on.
  Do you observe any difference in the performance statistics?  Why or
  why not?
</li><li> Turn in hard copy of your code, the items specified above, and
  visualizations of the cluster centroids (all 10 of them) for one
  run.  To help with that, you can grab <a href="https://courses.cs.umbc.edu/undergraduate/478/spring2022/MNIST%20Display.ipynb">this notebook</a> that shows how
  to read in the MNIST data and visualize it.  It assumes that the
  values are 8-bit integers.  Your centroids will be floats.
</li></ul>
